======

lib/x86/insn/ contains x86 instruction decoder src from Linux.

The following files were taken as-is from Linux@6d7d0603ca and
adapted to build with kvm-unit-tests source:
- U: lib/x86/insn/gen-insn-attr-x86.awk
- I: lib/x86/insn/inat.c
- I: lib/x86/insn/inat.h
- I: lib/x86/insn/inat_types.h
- I: lib/x86/insn/insn.c
- I: lib/x86/insn/insn.h
- U: lib/x86/insn/x86-opcode-map.txt

U: Unmodified, except source attribution.
I: Modified for #include path fixup.

lib/x86/insn/insn_glue.h contains additional code from Linux that
is relevant to the insn decoder, and not required elsewhere by
kvm-unit-tests. These definitions are placed in a separate file to
keep the diff between Linux and kvm-unit-tests's insn decoder copy
minimal.
